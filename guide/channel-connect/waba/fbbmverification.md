## Checklist for Business Verification

To increase the company's chances of being verified by Facebook, it is important that:
* The company's website is active and complete, containing the company's name and address
* The account email is from the same domain as the company's website provided in the documentation
* If the verification will be made through the phone number, make sure you are able to receive the call. If the phone has IVR, disable it temporarily
* The company's trade name in the documentation is the same used on the website and on the Facebook page. If different, the names need to be related in some way on the website. For example, at the footer, enter "Company ABC powered by company D"

After submitting the documentation, you will be informed via email about the progress of the company's verification.

No.
